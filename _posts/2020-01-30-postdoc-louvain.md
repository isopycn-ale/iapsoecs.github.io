The Georges Lemaître Centre for Earth and Climate Research (TECLIM; www.uclouvain.be/teclim) / Earth and Life Institute of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium is seeking a postdoctoral fellow for participation to the JPI Climate & Oceans project MEDLEY (MixED Layer hEterogeneitY) coordinated by the Laboratoire d'Océanographie Physique et Spatiale, Brest, France. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of the ocean mixed layer dynamics and improve its representation in global climate models.

The successful candidate will contribute to (1) diagnose the spatial heterogeneity of the mixed layer dynamics in ice-covered regions in models of different resolutions, (2) assess the impact of fragmented sea ice on air-sea fluxes in those models and (3) analyze the role of ice-ocean feedbacks in controlling the spatial heterogeneity of the mixed layer depth. He/she will also contribute to improve and test parameterizations of the spatial heterogeneity of the mixed layer dynamics in the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean; www.nemo-ocean.eu) model at a resolution similar to the one used in global climate models, with focus on polar oceans.

The successful candidate should have a PhD in ocean modelling or related field. Experience in polar oceanography is an asset. Advanced programming, post-processing and data managment/analysis skills are required. He/she should be fluent in English due to the multiple interactions planned with other project partners and should have demonstrated ability in team working.

The position is offered for 36 months, from June 2020. Note that it is only accessible to researchers who did not spend the last 2 years in a Belgian lab. The salary will be commensurate with experience according to the UCLouvain rates.

Applicants should send by February 24, 2020 at the latest (i) a statement of research experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV including a list of publications, and (iii) two letters of recommendation via e-mail to Prof. Thierry Fichefet (thierry.fichefet@uclouvain.be).
