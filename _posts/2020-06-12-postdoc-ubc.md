The Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of British Columbia invites applications for a Postdoctoral Fellow in the field of zooplankton ecology and modelling. The successful applicant will conduct research as part of a collaborative group investigating and modelling phytoplankton and zooplankton ecology of the Salish Sea. The candidate will be expected to take a lead role in performing model - data comparisons to evaluate an existing coupled bio-physical model (SalishSeaCast with SMELT salishsea.eos.ubc.ca) in collaboration with zooplankton and phytoplankton ecologists in Fisheries and Oceans, Canada and University of Washington. Once the model is evaluated, the candidate will use the model results to determine the drivers of seasonal and interannual variability in plankton in the Salish Sea to aid in understanding juvenile salmon survival.  In collaboration with modellers, the candidate will contribute to the development and testing of zooplankton mo
 del improvements. Other responsibilities include communications with partners, report preparation, presentation of results at conferences and the publication of research results in peer-reviewed, leading international journals.


Minimum Requirements: A Ph.D. in oceanography or a related field with both expertise in plankton ecology and a strong quantitative background. A broad understanding of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxonomic groups is required and knowledge of their life histories and ecologies, including relationships with physical processes is desirable. Programming knowledge with R, python or similar is required and experience handling large spatial data/results sets is preferred. Practice with comparisons using diverse data sets would be an asset; candidates with previous experience in evaluation of plankton models would be ideal. The candidate should have an excellent record of research competence demonstrated by publications in the peer-reviewed international scientific literature. The ideal candidate will be independent, self-motivated, collaborative, have excellent written communication skills, and be well organized. The position is for one-year, renewable for a second year and the start date
  can be as early as July 1, 2020. Salary is dependent upon educational level and experience; the minimum salary is $57,000 per year plus benefits.


Applications, including a CV, copies of two relevant publications, and the names, e-mails and phone numbers of three referees should be sent to Dr. Susan Allen (sallen@eoas.ubc.ca)<mailto:sallen@eoas.ubc.ca)>. Application review will start on June 15, 2020. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.
